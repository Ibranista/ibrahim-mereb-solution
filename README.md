# Mereb Technologies

## Introduction

Welcome to Mereb Technologies, a cutting-edge web development project designed to showcase efficient state management and data fetching techniques. This README.md file provides an overview of the project's structure, technologies used, and key features implemented.

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- Redux Toolkit
- Async Thunk
- CSS Modules
- Lodash (for fetching dummy data)
- Create React App
- CORS Everywhere

## Project Overview

Mereb Technologies is a sample web application designed to demonstrate scalable state management and data fetching techniques. The project implements Redux Toolkit with Async Thunk to efficiently handle asynchronous operations and manage global state.

## Key Features

1. Data Fetching: The application fetches dummy data from https://loripsum.net to simulate API calls.

2. State Management: Redux Toolkit is used to manage global state, providing a scalable solution for complex applications.

3. Asynchronous Operations: Async Thunk is implemented to handle asynchronous data fetching and caching.

4. Caching Mechanism: The application implements a caching system to store fetched data locally.

5. Scalability: The project is structured to be easily expandable, considering future growth and larger projects.

6. Styling: CSS Modules are used for component-specific styling, enhancing maintainability and reducing conflicts.

7. Spinner Component: An additional spinner component is implemented to provide visual feedback during loading operations.

## Implementation Details

### State Management

The project utilizes Redux Toolkit's createSlice and createAsyncThunk to define reducers and async actions. This approach provides a clean and efficient way to manage state changes and asynchronous operations.
