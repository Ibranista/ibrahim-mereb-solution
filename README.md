# Mereb Technologies

## Introduction

This README.md file provides an overview of the project's structure, technologies used, and key features implemented.

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- Redux Toolkit
- Async Thunk
- Create React App
- cors-anywhere

## Project Overview

Mereb Technologies is a sample web application designed to demonstrate scalable state management and data fetching techniques. The project implements Redux Toolkit with Async Thunk to efficiently handle asynchronous operations and manage global state.

## Key Features

1. Data Fetching: The application fetches dummy data from https://loripsum.net to simulate API calls.

2. State Management: Redux Toolkit is used to manage global state, providing a scalable solution for complex applications.

3. Asynchronous Operations: Async Thunk is implemented to handle asynchronous data fetching and caching.

4. Scalability: The project is structured to be easily expandable, considering future growth and larger projects.

5. Spinner Component: An additional spinner component is implemented to provide visual feedback during loading operations.

## Implementation Details

### State Management

The project utilizes Redux Toolkit's createSlice and createAsyncThunk to define reducers and async actions. This approach provides a clean and efficient way to manage state changes and asynchronous operations.
